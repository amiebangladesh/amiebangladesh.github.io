This page is about the atrocities of the government of Bangladesh done on the general students of different universities, colleges, and schools. Many students have already died including elderly and children by the armed forces and goons of Bangladesh Awami League (called Bangladesh Chatro League/ Bangladesh Student League) - a student wing of the political party.
