  <p align="justify">On June 07 2024, students in Bangladesh started protesting peacefully against the government's quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for the children and grandchildren of veterans who fought in the 1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh. Considering the quota reserved for women (10%), backward country locations (10%), ethnic minorities (5%) and people with physical disabilities (1%), the total reserved section goes up to 56%. This leaves only 44% for merit-based selection in government jobs. The system is unjust and discriminatory from the general students’ perspective and they wanted to reform it by increasing merit-based allocations. However, the response from the authorities has been alarmingly disproportionate. There have been multiple reports of brutality by police, RAB, BGB, Bangladesh Army and the Bangladesh Chhatra League, the ruling party’s political student wing, resulting in the tragic deaths of around 250+ students and general people nationwide who were merely exercising their rights to peaceful assembly. According to some sources, this number is more than 900. The Bangladeshi government has taken the drastic step of completely shutting down internet and mobile networks on 18 July 2024, in an attempt to suppress the protest and prevent the dissemination of information. The country was disconnected from the whole world for 7 consecutive days due to the complete shutdown of the internet along with the jamming of 2G and 3G networks. Even now, the internet usage is limited and they have restricted certain social networking apps to stop people from sharing information and their opinions. The government also declared a state of curfew throughout the nation on 20 July with ‘shoot at sight’ order and deployed the Army against civilians. This condition has further endangered the lives of students and citizens by isolating them from emergency services and communication with their families. To further suppress the free speaking right of general people, the government is arresting all the students and scholars who spoke against this mass killing and the tyrannical steps taken by the government. So far they have arrested more than 9 thousand people with false accusations and torturing them to keep their mouth shut. They are trying to forcefully suppress the people of Bangladesh and take away their democracy. The people of Bangladesh is standing together against the tyranny and the dictatorship of the current government. Please stand by the people of Bangladesh by raising your voice and speaking out about their current situation!</p>
